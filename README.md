Calculates a recoil values from an image annotated with red dots where the shots landed.

Starting from the bottommost dot, calculate angles between each dot, processing them upwards.

This only calculates recoil angle values, not distances. It could easily be modified to also output distances but I didn't need them for my purposes.
